### ABSTRACT
Art and design are essential aspects of our culture and how we interact with the world. Artists and designers use a wide selection of tools, whose impact is rapidly growing with the progression of digital technologies. This change has opened up new opportunities for the CHI community to build creative supportive tools. The digital switch has come with many benefits such as lowering barriers, mobile work environments and mass production for distribution of work. Along with these benefits we also see challenges for art and design work and its future perception in society. As technology takes a more significant role in supporting art and design what will this mean for the individual artist or designer? The focus of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to explore what the future of digital art and design will hold. The exploration will centre around synthesizing key challenges and questions, along with ideas for future interaction technologies that consider mobile and tangible aspects of digital art.

Today we are immersed in multiple realities, and the millennials have been born into the pleasures of Minecraft, the frustrations of Apple’s Siri, and the social story-worlds of massive multiplayer online role-playing games (M.M.O.R.P.G.s). Over and above, the popular culture, the walls between high-art and digital and immersive art have progressively come down, and with each progressive discovery the world dividing art and technology shrinks.

This book examines the growth of new media both as an art and science. To paraphrase her overall argument, Murray reasons, that though there is a tendency to think of the computer as “the enemy of the book,” it is in fact “the child of print culture” (Murray, 1997 MIT Press). The book is a powerful representational medium of its own that promises to continue the evolution of storytelling and “reshape the spectrum of narrative expression”.

While books are good at delivering essentially linear stories, she avers, that computers are good at telling stories of a different kind - “procedural, participatory, encyclopedic, and spatial”. And they are particularly good at telling stories that reflect the digital age - stories about fractured realities, complex systems, and networked ways of being in the world.

Trumping Murray’s argument is the 1994 book, The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality, where Michael Heim posits the question, “Are not all worlds symbolic? Including the one we naively refer to as the real world, which we read off with our physical senses?” This rings truer today where perception and the experience of art has moved beyond that can only be perceived in the ‘real’ world.

However, if we are going to delve into the world of digital art, we must start at the very beginning. Let us go back to circa 1968, when Ivan Sutherland created a virtual reality system that gave the user the ability to occupy the same ‘space’ as a computer generated wire-frame object. Or the summer of '69 (apologies to Bryan Adams), when Myron Krueger (b.1942) developed a series of art installations that strived to embrace and mimic the real world interaction. Krueger coined the term 'Artificial Reality' to describe a new genre of work in which the user’s physical body influenced the unfolding of meaning in the work of art.
